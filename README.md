# Online-Certificate-Generation-and-Verification
BE INFT Final Year Project 

# Introduction

In this project an application called Online Certificate Generation and Verification System is proposed

This project would focus on improving the processing time of certificate generation and verification systems by enabling multiple certificates generation simultaneously

The system also provides verification feature, where the 3rd party organizations can verify the genuineness of the certificate

# Scope

Facilitates Multiple Certificate Generation - The main goal of this project is to build a system which facilitates multiple certificate generation for the college authorities. ​

Automates Certificate Distribution - The system will be made such that the issuer can easily define the certificate template format and distribute the generated certificates to the students. ​

Enables Certificate Verification and maintains Integrity - The system facilitates the verification of the certificates that have been issued by it previously. The generation of certificate can be done online, and third parties can verify it. The verification of the certificates will be done with the help of the unique ID and hashing algorithm will be used to store and match the values. ​

Reduces Duplicity and Forgery of Certificates - The system would help in eradicating forgery of certificates since you need to be an authorized person to be able to generate certificates on the institute’s behalf.​
